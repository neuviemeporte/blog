This is mostly a place for recording my experience working on reverse engineering my [favourite game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-15_Strike_Eagle_II), and interesting stuff I've learned about MS-DOS programming and other retrocomputing platforms, which are a passion of mine.

Being a software dev, my job is mostly working with C/C++ code for low-level/system programming, generally sticking to what you might consider the deep backend. I learn some stuff occasionally, and I thought others might find it interesting and/or useful.

Finally, since I've worked in the industry for a number of years, I have some thoughts on the shape of it, and how plain code writing relates to the bigger picture of software architecture, project/team management and enabling business to release products and make a profit.
